    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This ricotta gnocchi recipe was passed down to me by my great-aunt. It is easy, traditional, and delicious!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <h4>Gnocchi</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>Â½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 dash crushed red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
        <li>6 basil leaves, finely shredded</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into small chunks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
       <li>Prepare the gnocchi: Stir together ricotta, eggs, Parmesan, salt, pepper, and garlic powder in a large bowl until evenly combined. Mix in 1 cup flour. Add additional flour if needed to form a soft dough.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 3 or 4 pieces and roll into 1/2-inch thick ropes on a floured surface. Cut each rope into 1-inch pieces and place on a lightly floured baking sheet. Place in the refrigerator until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic and cook until softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in diced tomatoes and red pepper flakes; bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook for 10 minutes. Stir in shredded basil and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>While sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Boil the gnocchi until they float to the surface, 1 to 2 minutes, then drain.</li> 
        <li>To assemble the dish: Stir cubed mozzarella into the sauce and allow the heat of the sauce to soften but not melt the cheese.</li>
        <li>Place gnocchi into a serving bowl and spoon sauce overtop. Enjoy!</li>
